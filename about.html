                <h2>Furniture That Fits is the brainchild of Dylan Drego, who one day needed a desk to fit in his bedroom.
                </h2><p>
                It was a weird little nook, and so he needed very specific dimensions. He searched far and wide for something to fit, but everything he found was either the wrong shape or just damn ugly. Being a man of both class and practicality, he set himself to building a desk made-to-fit. The beautiful creation was perfect, and just for him.
                </p><p>
                Later on in our story, he met up with a web developer named Rebecca Hill, who was having the exact same problem. She however had given up, and bought a quite expensive desk that fit a little oddly in the space she had available for it. They bonded over their shared frustrations and so it was that Dylan decided to use his fantastic design skills to design a website to help other people in their situation - with Rebecca on board to build it.
                </p><p>
                The last two characters we need to feature are Saumitra Kabra and Clint Rodrigues, who were working upstairs on morphing and constructing an array of ridiculously detailed three dimensional objects for their class. Dylan, you see, knew that the key to buying things online was to give the customer as much detail as possible, and if Saumitra and Clint could replicate the in-store experience of walking around a piece of furniture and inspecting how it might fit in a space, we'd have a winning combination. 
                </p><p>
                So that was that, and they all lived happily ever after!</p>
